    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I was first introduced to coding in middle school, and then again in high school. I took an introductory course to
    coding in college, which I also found interesting. I like how these courses, along with math, allowed me to develop
    problem solving skills. Code the Dream is the first program that I have attended for official coding instruction.</p>
