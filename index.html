        <section id="About"><h2>About</h2>
            <p>I am an aspiring software developer seeking to learn everything I can about full-stack development. 
                When I'm not coding, you can find me reading, baking, playing D&D, snuggling with my cat, winning pub trivia, or doing all of the above at the same time.

        <section id="Experience"><h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>Currently a student at Code the Dream, but in a past life I worked
                as a Manager of Project Coordination at NielsenIQ, which involved leading
                a team in market research project management, translating client needs
                into relevant survey questionnaires, and delivering actionable insights 
                on new product innovation and renovation.
