About
I was first introduced to coding in middle school, and then again in high school. I took an introductory course to
coding in college, which I also found interesting. I like how these courses, along with math, allowed me to develop
problem solving skills. Code the Dream is the first program that I have attended for official coding instruction.
Experience
I am currently enrolled in Code the Dream, where I am developing my coding skills.
