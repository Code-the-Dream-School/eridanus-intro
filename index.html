About
I'm currently twenty-years old and I go to ELAC, I hope to transfer next year and will be applying under 
the major of Computer Science. Although being a full time student, working, and completing the CTD program
takes up most of my time, in my free-time I like to go around Los Angeles trying out new places to eat
and going to hikes with my friends. Additionally, I also really like reading but that happens mainly 
during winter and summer breaks. 

Experience
My experience can be broken down into professional experience and part times I've had. The part time jobs
I've had all include some sort of warehouse work and up to about a year ago it also includes using warehouse
machinary. In terms of professional experience I've had two other internships from back when I was a business
major. I did two Real Estate internships, one was in Real Estate Digital Marketing where we learned the 
key logistics to look for and how to properly market real estate using online tools. The second one was in 
Commercial Real Estate where we learned valuation, and financial modeling.
