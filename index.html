<h1>Marice Romero</h1>

<h2>About</h2>
    <p>I am an aspiring software developer seeking to learn everything I can about full-stack development. 
        When I'm not coding, you can find me reading, baking, playing D&D, snuggling with my cat, winning pub trivia, or doing all of the above at the same time.
    </p>

<h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>Currently a student at Code the Dream, but in a past life I worked
        as a Manager of Project Coordination at NielsenIQ, which involved leading
        a team in market research project management, translating client needs
        into relevant survey questionnaires, and delivering actionable insights 
        on new product innovation.
